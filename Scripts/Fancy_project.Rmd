```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)

```

## R Markdown

```{r cars}
summary(diamonds)

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, colour = cut)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, position = "jitter") +
  geom_smooth()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
