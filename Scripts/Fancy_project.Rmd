## R Markdown

```{r cars}
summary(diamonds)


diamonds %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = carat)) +
           geom_lv()


ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = table, y = price)) +
 geom_point()


diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>%  
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
    geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
